This project defines a C structure named dog.

The dog structure has three members: name, age, and owner.

The name member is of type char *, representing the dog's name.

The age member is of type float, representing the dog's age.

The owner member is of type char *, representing the owner's name.

The project adheres to the specified requirements, including using the Betty style and no global variables.

Only allowed C standard library functions, such as printf, malloc, free, and exit, are used.

Include guards are implemented in the header file for proper inclusion protection.

The project follows good coding practices, including a README file for documentation.

It serves as a foundation for working with structured data in the C programming language.
