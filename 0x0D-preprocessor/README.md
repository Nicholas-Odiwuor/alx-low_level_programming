## Description

This project provides an example of creating a header file with a macro definition and adheres to specific coding standards.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source files using the provided GCC options.
3. Run the compiled program.

## File Structure

The project file structure is as follows:

- `myheader.h`: The header file containing the macro definition.
- `main.c`: An example source file to test the header file.

## Style

The code in this project follows the Betty style guidelines. You can check the code for compliance using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

## Function Limit

Each C source file in this project contains no more than 5 functions.

## Standard Libraries

This project only uses the following C standard library functions:
- `malloc`
- `free`
- `exit`

Any other standard library functions are not used.

## Testing

To test this project, compile the provided example source file, `main.c`, and run the resulting executable.

## Header File

To create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024, follow these steps:

1. Create a new header file, for example, "myheader.h".
2. Define the macro SIZE with the desired value (1024).
3. Ensure that your header file includes include guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

Example "myheader.h":

```c
#ifndef MYHEADER_H
#define MYHEADER_H

#define SIZE 1024

#endif /* MYHEADER_H */
Include Guards 
#ifndef HEADER_NAME and #define HEADER_NAME in the  header files.

c
Copy code
#ifndef HEADER_NAME
#define HEADER_NAME

#endif /* HEADER_NAME */
